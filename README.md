# Kafka Streams Application with Scala

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of a Kafka Streams application implemented in Scala. Kafka Streams is a client library for building applications and microservices, where the input and output data are stored in Kafka clusters. It enables developers to build robust and scalable stream processing applications.

## Application Overview
The Kafka Streams application described here is a simple word count application that consumes messages from an input topic, processes the messages to count the occurrences of each word, and produces the word counts to an output topic.

### Architecture
The application consists of the following components:
- **Kafka Topics**: Input and output topics in Kafka where messages are published and consumed.
- **Kafka Streams Application**: A Scala application that consumes messages from the input topic, processes them, and produces the word counts to the output topic.
- **Kafka Cluster**: A cluster of Kafka brokers where topics are stored and managed.

### Technologies Used
- Apache Kafka: A distributed streaming platform.
- Kafka Streams: A client library for building applications and microservices.
- Scala: A programming language that runs on the JVM and is well-suited for building scalable applications.

## Code Implementation
Below is a simplified implementation of the Kafka Streams application in Scala:

```scala
import org.apache.kafka.streams._
import org.apache.kafka.streams.scala._
import org.apache.kafka.streams.scala.ImplicitConversions._
import org.apache.kafka.streams.scala.Serdes._

object WordCountApplication extends App {
  val builder: StreamsBuilder = new StreamsBuilder
  val textLines: KStream[String, String] = builder.stream[String, String]("input-topic")
  val wordCounts: KTable[String, Long] = textLines
    .flatMapValues(_.toLowerCase.split("\\W+"))
    .groupBy((_, word) => word)
    .count()

  wordCounts.toStream.to("output-topic")
  
  val streams: KafkaStreams = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), AppConfig.streamsConfig)
  streams.start()
}
```
